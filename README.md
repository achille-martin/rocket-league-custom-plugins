* Microsoft account
* BakkesMod: https://www.bakkesmod.com/index.php

## Setup
* Clone this repo to your <desired_path>/<this_repo_name>
* Get Visual Studio 2019 (Community): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/

* Under Create a New Project (on the home page) -> Search for BakkesMod -> Click on BakkesPluginTemplate
* Set location to your <desired_path>/<this_repo_name>

  plugin already exists in the repo, copy the existing plugin folder outside the
  repo, create the template, paste the existing plugin content back into your
  repo, then look at the git rules
* Create the template
* Build the solution to make sure your setup is correct

## Git rules
1) Add to the .gitignore all unwanted files created by Visual Studio
2) Create branches if you work on features for a plugin with multiple people
involved (otherwise you can work on main branch)
3) Before pushing, make sure that your solution builds (or ask for a Review /
Merge Review)

## Usage
1) SDK way of using the plugin
* Launch BakkesMod
* Launch Rocket League
* Build the solution (for your desired custom plugin) in Visual Studio: this
  will update the plugin in BakkesMod
* Open the console (F6) in BakkesMod and enter your <start_notifier_event>
  command. Alternatively you can use the .set files to configure your plugin
  from the "Plugins" Tab in BakkesMod (F2)

2) Non-tech way of using the plugin
* Copy the <plugin_name>.dll from <plugin_folder>/plugins
* Paste the <plugin_name>.dll to the BakkesMod path: ...AppData\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\plugins
